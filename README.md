# Creative Coding

## Introduction

This is a collection of small pieces of generative art.

This repo will begin with samples I created in Bruno Imbrizi's DomÃªstika course 
[Creative Coding: Making Visuals with Javacript](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/2729-creative-coding-making-visuals-with-javascript/course).
This course was a short and beginner-friendly introduction using the 
[canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) framework. 
Canvas-sketch makes is very easy to play, experiment, create generative art 
and animations and export them in various formats.

I thought the examples in this course looked really nice and would make a great starter.
In the future I want to add more examples of creative coding and generative art. Anything 
that's creative and doesn't fit into any of the other repos can find its home here. It won't 
be limited to canvas-sketch alone. It could be anything that can be considered a sketch or "art" 
regardless of what language or library used, and regardless of whether it's a static image, an 
animation, interactive or not. The only rule is that it was created _programmatically_, after all, 
it's about creative _coding_. :)

## Installation and Usage

Pick a demo folder, install packages with

  `npm install`
  
see the readme.md file in the folder for instructions on how to run canvas-sketch and export 
images or animations.
